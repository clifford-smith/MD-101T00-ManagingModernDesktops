# Practice Lab: Configuring Co-Management Using Configuration Manager

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure Co-Management using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. 

### Scenario

Contoso has both a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager implementation and Microsoft Intune. You need to configure integration between the two services and enable co-management for your managed Windows 10 devices. You will configure co-management and then validate the settings using SEA-CL1.

### Task 1: Prepare the environment

1.  Switch to **SEA-SVR1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.
2.  Select **Start**, expand **Windows Administrative Tools**, and then select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
3.  In the navigation pane, select **Seattle Clients**.
4.  Right-click **SEA-CL1** and then select **Move**.
5.  In the **Move** dialog box, select **Azure AD clients** and then select **OK**.
6.  Close **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
7.  On the taskbar, right-click **Start** and select **Windows Powershell (Admin)**.
8.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial

```

9. Close the PowerShell window.

10. Switch to **SEA-CL1**.

11. On the taskbar, right-click **Start**, select **Shut down or sign out** and then select **Restart**.

    _Note: The reboot will trigger the hybrid Azure AD join on SEA-CL1._

12. After **SEA-CL1** has restarted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

13. On the taskbar, right-click **Start** and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

14. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
dsregcmd /status

```

15. In the output under **Device State**, verify that **AzureAdJoined : YES** and **DomainJoined : YES** are displayed.

 _Note: If the device is not yet joined to Azure AD wait for the Azure AD Connect sync to complete and reboot SEA-CL1 again._

16. Close all windows on SEA-CL1.

### Task 2: Create a device collection

1. On **SEA-CFG1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. On the taskbar, select **Configuration Manager Console**. The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager console opens.
3. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections**. 
4. Right-click **Device Collections** and then select **Create Device Collection**. The Create Device Collection Wizard opens.
5. On the **General** page, configure the following and then select **Next**:
   - Name: **Co-managed Devices**
   - Limiting collection: **All Desktop and Server Clients**
6. On the **Membership Rules** page, select **Next**. At the Configuration Manager warning, select **OK**. You will add a direct member at a later step.
7. On the **Summary** page, select **Next** and then at the **Completion** page, select **Close**. 

### Task 3: Assign a Device to an existing Collection

1.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Devices**. Take note of the devices listed. Any device that has a green circle with a white checkmark are currently active.
2.  In the details pane, select **SEA-CL1**.
3.  Right-click **SEA-CL1**, point to **Add Selected Items**, and then select **Add Selected Items to Existing Device Collection**.
4.  On the **Select Collection** dialog box, select **Co-managed Devices**, and then select **OK**.
5.  To verify, in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections** and then double-click **Co-managed Devices**. SEA-CL1 should be listed as a member of this collection.

### Task 4: Tenant attach Endpoint Configuration Manager 

1.  In the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager console, select the **Administration** workspace.
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services** and then select **Co-management**. 
3.  In the ribbon, select **Configure co-management**. The **Co-management Configuration Wizard** opens.
4.  In the **Co-management Configuration Wizard**, on the **Tenant onboarding** page, select **Sign In**.
5.  Sign in as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the default tenant password. After you are signed in, select Next.
6.  On the **Create AAD Application** warning, select **Yes**.
7.  On the **Configure upload** page, accept the default and select **Next**.
8.  On the **Enablement** page, next to **Automatic enrollment in Intune**, select the drop-down and then select **Pilot**.
9.  On the **Enablement** page, next to **Intune Auto Enrollment**, select **Browse**.
10.  In the **Select Collection** dialog box, select **Co-managed Devices** and then select **OK**. Select **Next**.
11.  On the **Workloads** page, drag the slider to **Pilot Intune** for the following workloads, and then select **Next**:
     - **Compliance policies**
     - **Client apps**
     - **Windows Update policies**
12.  On the **Staging** page, select **Browse** next to **Compliance policies**, **Client Apps**, and **Windows Update Policies** and select the **Co-managed Devices** collection for each workload. Select **Next**.
13.  On the **Summary** page, select **Next** and then on the **Completion** page, select **Close**.

### Task 5: Validate that SEA-CL1 is co-managed 

1.  Switch to SEA-CL1.
2.  On the taskbar select **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://aad.portal.azure.com**, and then press **Enter**.
4.  Sign in as user **Admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**, and use the tenant Admin password. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.
5.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
6.  In the **Contoso|Overview** page, under **Manage**, select **Devices**. 
7.  Verify that **SEA-CL1** is listed and that **Join Type** is **Hybrid Azure AD Join**.
8.  In Microsoft Edge open another tab and type **https://endpoint.microsoft.com** in the address bar, and then press **Enter**. 
9.  In the navigation pane, select **Devices** and then select **All devices**.
10.  Verify that **SEA-CL1** is listed with the **Managed by** setting set to **Co-managed**. It may take some time to appear. Refresh the details pane as needed.
11.  Select **SEA-CL1** and in the details pane scroll down to display information related to the Co-managed state.
11.  Close Microsoft Edge.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured co-management using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.
