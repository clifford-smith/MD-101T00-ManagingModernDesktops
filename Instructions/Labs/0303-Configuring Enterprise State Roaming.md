# Practice Lab: Configuring Enterprise State Roaming

## Summary

In this lab, you will enable Enterprise State Roaming in Azure AD. 

### Scenario

Enterprise State Roaming in Azure AD provides the ability for user settings and application settings to be synchronized to the cloud. Diego Siciliani works with multiple Windows devices and would like to have all user settings to be the same on each device. You need to enable and test Enterprise State Roaming to address Diego's requirements.


### Task 1: Enable Enterprise State Roaming

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3. In Microsoft Edge, type **https://aad.portal.azure.com** in the address bar, and then press **Enter**. 

4. Sign in as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the tenant Admin password.

5. In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

6. On the **Contoso** blade, in the navigation pane, select **Devices**.

7. On the **Devices** blade, make a note of devices that are listed in the details pane. In the Devices navigation pane, select **Enterprise State Roaming**.

8. On the **Devices|Enterprise State Roaming** blade, in the details pane, next to **Users may sync settings and app data across devices** section, select **Selected**.

9. Select **Selected No member selected**, select **Add** and type **Diego Sicilian** in the text box.

10. Select **Diego Siciliani** and then select **Select**.

11. Select **OK**, and then select **Save**. Close the **Devices | Enterprise State Roaming** blade.

    _Note: By performing this task, you enabled Enterprise State Roaming for Diego Siciliani._


### Task 2: Verify sync is enabled on SEA-WS2

1.  Switch to **SEA-WS2** and sign in as **DiegoS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the default tenant password if you are not already signed in. 
    
2.  On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select the **Settings** icon.

   _**Important**: If Sync settings is set to off and it is greyed out, restart the device and sign back in. If the settings remain greyed out then you must rejoin to Azure AD.  This is due to an issue with ESR being enabled after devices have been enrolled. If this occurs, continue with Task 3, otherwise skip Task 3 and continue with Task 4._
